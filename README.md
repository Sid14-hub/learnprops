**A Card Making Dome Project**

Started lerning React

This project is done by using **props** and **Array.map()** method.

I have created a component of card in Component folder and made a Content.js file which is having all the properties needed for card


**Props Defination**

Props are arguments passed into React components.
Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

In simple words props are the properties we pass in a React Component while calling it and we pass this property via HTML attributes.

For example refer to the App.js file.

**props stands for properties**

Array.map()
map() creates a new array.
map() calls a function once for each element in an array.
